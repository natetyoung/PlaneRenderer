This is a sweeping project that I sunk all kinds of time and code into. It is based on an idea I had - if it's supposed to be so easy to raytrace things as point clouds, why not render them as plane clouds?

I thought it would preserve time efficiency while making the shape appear more connected.

Turns out, it doesn't really work. It worked for some objects, but not for all, and since this version is after I tried haphazardly to fix some particularly intractable problems, it is well and truly broken.

Nice while it lasted though, and taught me a lot about rendering.
